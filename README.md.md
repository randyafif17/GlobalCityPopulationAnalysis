### 💻 Overview
This project aims to provide an analysis of the population metrics of major cities around the world. The data covers 20 cities across different continents and aims to explore various aspects of population distribution.

### 🎯 Objectives
- To calculate the average population for cities in each continent
- To identify the city with the maximum population in each continent
- To determine the city with the minimum population in each continent
- To calculate the total population for cities in each continent

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python for data manipulation
- SQL for data querying
- Excel/CSV for data storage
- Dataset

### 📑 The dataset includes the following information for each city:
- ID
- Name
- Country
- Continent
- Population (in millions)

### 🔍 Methodology
- Data Collection: The data was initially collected in CSV format containing details about each city.
- Data Cleaning: Irrelevant or missing data points were identified and cleaned.
- Data Analysis: Various metrics like average, maximum, minimum, and total population were calculated for each continent using Python.

### 📈 Findings
- Asia has the highest average population among its major cities, with Tokyo being the most populated.
- Europe has the lowest average population among its major cities, with Istanbul as the only entry.
- North America has a more balanced distribution, with Mexico City and New York almost equally populated.

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run your_script.py to generate the analysis. (Replace your_script.py with the actual name of your script)
3. The output will be saved in the output directory as a CSV file.
